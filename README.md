# Roommate Shopping

If you live with roommates, you may have to purchase items, which are shared by everyone (e.g., everyone needs paper towels, bread,and dishwasher detergent). It would be useful to have a common place for recording shopping needs for such shared items, and then recording shopping expenses (who bought what items, when and what was the cost). One of the roommates going to a store could look at the current shopping list and then purchase and record the cost of some of the needed items. This is what this app tries to accomplish. 

### Prerequisites

You can open the following repository as an Android Studio project, and run the app on a mobile device or virtual device (AVD).
When doing so you need to add each sample app you wish to try to a Firebase project on the Firebase console. 
For an example on how to add Firebase to your Android project the following link may be helpful
